Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space exploration by developing reusable rockets, significantly reducing the cost of space missions. One of the most critical factors in achieving reusability is the successful landing of Falcon 9 rocket boosters after launch.

This project focuses on analyzing historical Falcon 9 launch data and building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a successful landing. By predicting landing outcomes, we can:

Understand the key factors influencing rocket landings (such as payload mass, orbit type, launch site, and flight number).

Provide insights into how launch conditions affect success rates.

Demonstrate how data science and machine learning can be applied in aerospace research to support cost reduction strategies.

The project workflow includes:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Using datasets from SpaceX and public sources, we preprocessed the data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized launch trends, success rates over time, and the influence of different parameters (payload, orbit, site).

Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features such as booster version, flight number, and payload category.

Model Development: Implemented and compared machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to classify whether a rocket would land successfully.

Evaluation: Assessed models based on accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable predictions.
